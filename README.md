# Welcome to My World

There are two views of my work: 

### Code on GitHub.com
You can see the actual code I wrote if you view this repository on [github.com/leoneckert/leonCCLab](https://github.com/leoneckert/leonCCLab).

### Live Versions on GitHub Pages
If you want to see the rendered versions of each web project, you will have to visit the GitHub Page instead: [leoneckert.github.io/leonCCLab](https://leoneckert.github.io/leonCCLab/) 

### Some of my projects:
Below links will lead you to either the code or the live version depending on whether you see this page on github.com or github.io. Use above links to switch!

- [My first website](my-first-website/index.html)
- [Here I learned CSS](web-with-style)
- [and this is my template for future projects. it includes a p5 canvas](templateP5)
- [simple sound sketch](soundInP5_1)

more to come, see you soon!
