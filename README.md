# Welcome to My World

here you can see my code: [https://github.com/leoneckert/leonCCLab](https://github.com/leoneckert/leonCCLab)
and this is the live version of it on GitHub Pages: [https://leoneckert.github.io/leonCCLab/](https://leoneckert.github.io/leonCCLab/) 

this is the root, or very base of my cclab folder. 

if you see this on a url that looks like 

leoneckert.github.io/repo-name

then you can append project/website/folder names to the url to get to the actual webpages.
